This cunning whale had previously severed Ahab's leg, driving the captain to an all-consuming obsession. The novel begins with Ishmael, a penniless Manhattanite, traveling to New Bedford, Massachusetts, to embark on his first whaling voyage. There, he meets and befriends Queequeg, a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner. The two men bond and decide to sail together. After attending a sermon by Father Mapple about the story of Jonah, they head to Nantucket and secure berths on the whaling ship Pequod, owned by the Quaker ship-owners Bildad and Peleg. The ship's crew is a diverse group of men from various nationalities, including the chief mate Starbuck, second mate Stubb, third mate Flask, and harpooners Queequeg, Tashtego, and the mysterious Fedallah, who is part of a special crew hidden on the ship by Ahab. When Ahab finally appears on deck, he reveals his true purpose for the voyage: not for profit, but for revenge against the white whale that took his leg. He nails a doubloon to the mast and promises it to the first man to sight Moby Dick. Starbuck objects, but the crew is ultimately swayed by Ahab's fiery conviction. The Pequod embarks on a long and winding journey through the Atlantic and Indian oceans. Along the way, Ishmael provides detailed descriptions of cetology (the study of whales) and the rituals of whaling. The ship encounters other vessels, and Ahab always questions their captains for any news of Moby Dick. These encounters often bring grim tidings and cautionary tales, such as the prophet Gabriel on the Jeroboam and Captain Boomer of the Samuel Enderby, who also lost an arm to the white whale but is content to have survived. As the journey progresses, Ahab's obsession deepens, isolating him from the crew and casting a sense of dread over the ship. Strange and ominous events occur, like the harpooner Tashtego falling into a whale's head and being rescued, and the cabin boy Pip going mad after being lost at sea."
